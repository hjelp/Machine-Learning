# Machine-Learning

Projects I´ve worked on:

- Predicting Property Prices for NYC with XGBoost, SVM, MLP and Linear regression.ipynb

*Predicting Housing Prices for New York City*. Our aim with this machine learning project is to develop a model that can predict sale prices for properties in New York City. We will be using the NYC Property Sales dataset, which contains data about 83,783 properties sold over a 12 month period in 2016 and 2017. We will experiment with four different families of algorithms in order to find the best one for this task: Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and a Neural Network.
